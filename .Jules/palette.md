## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** Streamlit apps require different UX strategies than React apps. Standard HTML/CSS tweaks are harder to inject cleanly.
**Action:** Focus on Streamlit's native parameters (like `help=`, `placeholder=`, `on_click=`) and use `st.markdown` carefully for styling.

## 2025-05-22 - Tooltips in Streamlit
**Learning:** Streamlit's `help` parameter is the most robust way to add accessibility context (tooltips) to buttons, as it renders natively and works across themes without custom CSS.
**Action:** Always check `st.button`, `st.text_input`, and `st.popover` for `help=` opportunities before attempting custom HTML injection.
